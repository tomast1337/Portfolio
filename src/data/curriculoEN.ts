  Resumo: `I'm Nicolas, a programmer with 8 years of studies in the field. I began studying software development in 2016 while attending FAETEC's technical high school, where I focused on Java development. Since then, I've continued to build my skills and knowledge through self-study and my current studies in Computer Science at CEFET/RJ.

I'm particularly interested in fullstack development because I enjoy being involved in all aspects of a project, from the front-end to the back-end. For me, it's all about finding the best solution to the problem at hand, regardless of the technology stack or business domain.
        
Currently, I'm an intern at TCU,Federal Court of Accounts , in the Data Science area, where I work with Python, PowerBI, SQL, and other technologies. My goal is to transition into a software development role, which was my original career objective 8 years ago.
        
In addition to my work at TCU, I'm a part-time fullstack developer at BetaBit, where I work with React, NestJS, NodeJS, Typescript, PostgreSQL, AWS, and other technologies.`,
